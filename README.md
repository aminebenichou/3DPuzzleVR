An individual scientific project, "3D Puzzle VR for Anatomy Education". The project focused on delivering basic knowledge of anatomical models through VR. Using device HTC Vive and its motion controllers to interact with model and its objects. 

In this educational game, the three anatomical models were used Skull, Foot and Knee. But they are not including in this repository since they are subjected to be used in final product.

In order to understand the code and make it work, there is a human bot model for testing.

Cheers
